# 2FAuth

## Introduction

2FAuth is an application to manage différent OTP identities.
It lets you scan a QRCode or type in the identity by hand.
You can then get your OTP when needed.
This project is aimed at being open-source.

## To-Do
- Change the design, switch to a side-menu to navigate through the different identities and the management
- Change the identity storage (Currently LocalStorage, it would be wise use a SQLite/LokiJS/IndexedDB/CouchDB)
- Set a master password & encrypt the database
- Possibility to edit an identity
